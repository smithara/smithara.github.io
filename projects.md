## ESA's Swarm mission data access tools: VirES & VRE

VirES is a data access, visualisation, and processing platform for the [*Swarm*](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/swarm) satellite mission. It is developed for ESA by [EOX IT Services](https://eox.at) and is a free and open source project. I got involved initially by working as an intern at EOX in the summer of 2018. Try out the web interface: [VirES for Swarm](https://vires.services); or the upcoming [Aeolus version](https://aeolus.services).

I have been responsible for building the Python package "viresclient" which provides programmatic access to the Swarm data and models through VirES.

I am also assisting with the new "Virtual Research Environment" (VRE) service by providing user-facing documentation to help scientists make use of the service, as well as consultation to guide its ongoing development and support.
