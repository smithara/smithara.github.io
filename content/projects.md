## Software and data

*I support ESA's Swarm mission through the VirES & VRE projects*

[VirES](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/vires-for-swarm) is a data access, visualisation, and processing platform for the [Swarm mission](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/swarm). It is developed for ESA by [EOX IT Services](https://eox.at). I got involved initially by working as an intern at EOX in the summer of 2018.

The VirES service is paired with the ["Virtual Research Environment" (VRE)](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/swarm-vre) which provides a ready-to-use Jupyter environment for programmatic interaction with Swarm products.

I am responsible for:
- [viresclient](https://viresclient.readthedocs.io): a Python package which talks with the VirES server to retrieve Swarm data and models 
    - [First presentation at Swarm DQW9 (2019)](https://smithara.github.io/SwarmDQW9_viresclient_presentation/viresclient.slides.html)
- [Swarm Notebooks](https://notebooks.vires.services/): recipes to help people get started
- [SwarmPAL](https://swarmpal.readthedocs.io/): containing scientist-written toolboxes to perform specific analyses
- Curating content for the [Swarm Handbook](https://swarmhandbook.earth.esa.int/catalogue/index)

## Education and outreach

*I am currently serving as co-chair for the [IAGA ICEO](https://iaga-aiga.org/index.php?id=education-outreach) (International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, Interdivisional Commission on Education and Outreach)*

Geomagnetism is a relatively unknown field (and different people define it differently!). Newcomers, whether they are curious members of the public or scientists or engineers, can be quite lost without a guiding hand. [**Magnetic Earth - magneticearth.org**](https://magneticearth.org) is the starting point for a community-built resource to introduce the subject: the science, the tools, and the organisations involved.

At the biennial [IAGA Schools](https://iaga-aiga.org/iagaschool/) we provide an intensive week of lectures spanning across the broad spectrum of IAGA science. This is supported with interactive notebooks: [Exploring our Mangnetic Earth](https://book.magneticearth.org).

## Support for Swarm DISC

*As a member of the Swarm Data, Innovation, and Science Cluster, I regularly attend the annual Data Quality Workshops and assist the consortium in various ways*
