# Who am I?

I am a PDRA at the University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences. I am working on software tools to help scientists better utilise data from ESA's Swarm mission - a constellation of spacecraft at Low Earth Orbit (about 400-500km altitude) which measure Earth's magnetic fields - read more at [Magnetic Earth](https://magneticearth.org/).
